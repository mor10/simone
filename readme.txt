Simone is a responsive modern design theme designed and developed by Morten Rand-Hendriksen. 

Simone\'s design is focussed on typography and aims to put the content front and center. Fonts are large and clear and scale according to screen width. On wider screens blockquotes and images can be aligned left and right to break out of the main stream and get a pull-quote effect. The featured images are responsive through the use of the <picture> element resulting in appropriate image sizes being loaded to fit individual screen sizes.


== Changelog ==
=== 1.0.2 ===
- Featured image on single posts and pages and the first post on index page now responsive with <picture> element
- Fixed .screen-reader-text based on http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/hiding-content-for-accessibility


== Description ==
=== Customizer Options ===
Extended options available from the Customizer:

1. Header background color
2. Header text color
3. Link color (changes link colors throughout the site including site title. Also sets color of .border-custom class.)
4. Optional Header image of 1280px x 300px

=== Widgetized Areas ===
1. Right sidebar, max content width 300px.
2. Footer, max content width 320px.

=== Post Formats ===
Standard and Aside post formats are supported. Asides are displayed without headings or meta content in index pages. All other displays are identical with Standard posts.

=== Featured Images ===
Posts and pages can have Featured Images. On single posts and pages max Featured Image (Post Thumbnail) size is 1060px x 650px. On index pages the featured image is displayed in 780px x 250px hard crop.

=== Optional Social Media menu ===
The header features an optional social media menu which is displayed on the far right of the menu area. Social media icons are automatically generated based on the URLs of different social media services so a link menu item with a Twitter URL will automatically show the Twitter icon etc. To activate the menu simply create a new menu and assign it to the Social Menu template location.
The social menu is inspired by this [article by Justin Tadlock](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2013/08/14/social-nav-menus-part-2).

=== Extras ===
Simone ships with three border options for images and other elements that can be applied by adding a class to the desired element. The classes add a 1px solid border around the current element. The classes are .border-black (black), .border-gray (#b9b9b9 or 25% gra), and .border-custom (defaults to header color but is overridden by custom link color in Customizer). These classes are added to allow the user to add borders in a semantic and standards based way.
